===============================

This is an interpretation of the classic arcade game Frogger. Instead of a frog, you are a little boy trying to cross a multi-lane road to get to the lake and go fishing. 

Movement
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the boy in that direction. 

Hazards
Watch out for the cars because just like in real life, a collision with one of them will kill you. The cars tend to move faster in the inner lanes (the ones closer to the lake/farther from the grass).

Lives
You have three (3) lives to cross the road successfully. Whether you succeeded or failed, you will have another opportunity to play again. You can also start over at any time by reloading the page.

Good Luck!
